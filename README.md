Advanced User Authentication System
This project implements a sophisticated user authentication system using Django as the backend and React as the frontend. It includes features like user roles, permissions, JWT-based authentication, email verification, password reset, and user profile management. The frontend state is managed using Redux, providing a scalable and maintainable solution.

User Roles: Define roles for users (admin, user) with corresponding permissions.
JWT Authentication: JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication.
Email Verification: Verify user email addresses during registration.
Password Reset: Allow users to reset their passwords via email.
User Profile Management: Enable users to update their personal information.
